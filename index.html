          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>I think my style is more about muted colors and minimalism, so that's what I'd like my portfolio site to look like. I don't have any previous experience, but I'd like my projects to inclue an app for wearable technology (Hopefully I can accomplish that during this course or on my own time with what I learn) and a project for my current employer where we can enable customers to place recurring orders with one click. I would also like to include some of my jewelry designs, if appropriate. </p>

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>I'm planning on committing at least 15 hours a week, and more whenever I can. I'm not sure about splitting up the projects yet, because I'm not sure how long it will take me to really understand all the concepts, but I expect myself to complete at least an excersise a day. At the end of this course, I want to have a diverse portfolio with a strong style so that I can apply for junior developer positions.</p>

          <h2>Course Goals</h2>
          <p>I'm changing careers, and I would love to hired as an entry level developer within the first couple months after finishing this course. I have been given the opportunity by my current employer to create an app for our company and manage our website in the mean time, and hopefully I can pick up some low pressure freelance work with others I know while I'm studying to practice working with clients.</p>
